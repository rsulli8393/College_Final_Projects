# Data-Projects
Currently, I am attaching the papers related to my data projects. Later, I will add the code. 

The Census Bureau project has the R data code attached in the appendix.

The Data Visualization project is code based on files downloaded from the United Nations - it attempts to tell a story about human development based on certain years and collections of information.
